## i0 — genesis — 2026-07-04T00:00:00Z
- did: Repo seeded from the founding conversation (human + Claude). Charter, pipeline
  protocol, record schema, tooling, marketplace manifest, plugin-smith shipped at
  0.1.0, commit-craft specced, 3 idea records, job-traveler catalog v0.
- line: plugin-smith → published (genesis exception: no QA pass of record — a P1
  post-publish re-test is already in the backlog to hold it to the real bar);
  commit-craft → spec.
- files: everything.
- validation: pass
- next-suggestion: B1 — baseline audit.
- notes: The workshop starts unnamed on purpose; the Ceremony is early (B7) because
  marketplace names travel with install commands. Plugin schema verified against
  https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins-reference at seed time — re-verify before
  trusting memory.
